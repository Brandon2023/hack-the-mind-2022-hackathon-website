    <h2>But How ?</h2>
    <P class = "fortnite1">With efficient use of technology and our combined programming skills, 
      we have created a website that can help people with learning about their own wellbeing. We have created multiple ideas to assist the average person in sustaining a stable and healthy peace of mind.
      We plan on making our care PREVENTATIVE, meaning that it prevents the problem before it grows out of control. 
      These tools include a depression tester, an anxiety tester, and even an ADHD tester!</p>

      All in all, we just want to create a better world! An ideal world where less people are depressed, where anxiety is a thing of the past, and an ideal 
      world where everyone can share a piece of their happiness.
