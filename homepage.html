    <h2>But How ?</h2>
    <P class = "fortnite1">With efficient use of technology and our combined programming skills, 
      we have created a website that can help people with learning about their own wellbeing. We have created multiple ideas to assist the average person in sustaining a stable and healthy peace of mind.
      We plan on making our care PREVENTATIVE, meaning that it prevents the problem before it grows out of control. 
      These tools include a depression tester, an anxiety tester, and even an ADHD tester!</p>

    <h3>Our Motivation</h3>
    <p>Being unhappy and anxious is something many of us has experienced.
      Unfortunately, this unhappiness and anxiety can become a huge problem that impedes daily life for many people. However, with our program, 
      a user can be informed of their mental well-being and ways of improving their mental health. 
      Not only is our solution simple and concise, it provides the user with detailed information very quickly. </p>

  <div class = "4th para">
    <h3>The Future of Mental Health</h3>
    <p>
      All in all, we just want to create a better world! An ideal world where less people are depressed, where anxiety is a thing of the past, and an ideal 
      world where everyone can share a piece of their happiness. 
      For us, our happiness comes from helping others. Therefore, we hope our tool will prove to be useful in hacking the minds of people around the world!
